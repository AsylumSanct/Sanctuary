# Holding

## **Holding the NFTs:**

Whether you buy a Cultist or Ghost from a secondary marketplace (or if you were fortunate enough to mint), you will receive a share of each rebase diversion as long as the NFT is in your wallet. When/if you decide to sell, the purchasing wallet will begin to receive the rewards, until/if they decide to sell, so on and so forth.

A % of each rebase will be distributed proportionately to holders of the Cultist and Ghost NFTs. \
\
_The more you hold, the higher your proportionate reward is._ \
\
**Generally, the equations are:**\
\
_TVL x 0.4% x 1% / 789 Per Cultist held._\
_TVL x 0.4% x 0.5% / 789 Per Ghost held paired with a Cultist (same Ghosts : Cultist ratio)._\
_TVL x 0.4% x 0.25% / 789 Per Ghost held unpaired minus paired Ghosts (see above)._\
\
You will be able to buy and sell the Cultists & Ghosts and the reward distribution will follow. This gives the NFTs a stable price floor that appreciates over time. As the TVL grows, the rebase total increases, which results in higher rewards per NFT held.

## **Picturing the way it works:**

Imagine taking 1% of $1,000,000 that is spread amongst 10,000 people evenly. They each would get $99 each instead of $100.

That leaves us with $10,000 to dispense to each NFT.\
\
$10,000 / 789 - each NFT gets 12$.

When you divert a small allocation from a large pool with many investors and funnel it down to a smaller more exclusive group, it becomes a substantial amount.

Additionally, each of those original 10,000 people have the opportunity at any time to become holders of the NFTs, to receive even higher returns:\
\
$111 instead of $99 for holding just 1 Cultist.

## Genesis Snapshot Multipler

For wallets that were included in the Genesis snapshot, all rewards will be increased by 10% per NFT held at the time of the snapshot, forever. Each wallet had only one chance to apply the Genesis multiplier, no future snapshots will occur. See the relevant channel in Discord for the Genesis Snapshot list.

# NFT Holder Benefits

### Cultist and Ghost NFT Holder Benefits w/o Genesis

Each wallet holding at least 1 Cultist or Ghost will be distributed a share of the 1% (Cultists Diversion Pool) or 0.5% (Ghosts Diversion Pool) from the total rebase indefinitely.

### Genesis Snapshot Multipler

For wallets that are holding Cultists that _aren't listed at all_ during the Genesis snapshot, all rewards will be increased by 10% per NFT held at the time of the snapshot, forever. Each wallet has only one chance to apply the Genesis multiplier, no future snapshots will occur. We're capping this at a maximum of 30 Cultists to keep it fair to the community. Exact equation pending.

**Holding the NFTs:**

Whether you mint or buy a Cultist, you will receive your share as long as the NFT is in your wallet. When/if you decide to sell, the purchasing wallet will begin to receive the rewards, until/if they decide to sell, so on and so forth.

A % of each rebase will be distributed proportionately to holders of the Cultist and Ghost NFTs. The more you hold, the higher your proportionate reward is. Generally, the equations are:\
\
_TVL x 0.4% x 1% / 789 Per Cultist held._\
_TVL x 0.4% x 0.5% / 789 Per Ghost held paired with a Cultist (same Ghosts:Cultist ratio)._\
_TVL x 0.4% x 0.25% / 789 Per Ghost held unpaired minus paired Ghosts (see above)._\
\
You will be able to buy and sell the Cultists & Ghosts and the reward distribution will follow. This gives the NFTs stable, appreciating value.

**A simple way to picture the way it works:**

Imagine taking 1% of $1,000,000 that is spread amongst 10,000 people evenly. They each would get $99 each instead of $100.

That leaves us with $10,000 to dispense to each NFT.\
\
Ex: $10,000 / 789 - each NFT gets 12$.

When you divert a small allocation from a large pool with many investors, while funneling it down to a smaller more exclusive group, it becomes a substantial amount.

Additionally, each of those original 10,000 people have the opportunity at any time to become holders of the NFTs, to receive even higher returns, as well as ownership of an asset with real appreciating value (Cultist & Ghost NFTs).

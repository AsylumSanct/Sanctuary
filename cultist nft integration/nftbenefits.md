Each Cultist will be distributed a share of the 1% diverted from the total rebase indefinitely. Transferable.



## Genesis Snapshot Multipler
For wallets that are holding Cultists that *aren't listed at all* during the Genesis snapshot, all rewards will be increased by 10% per NFT held at the time of the snapshot, forever. Each wallet has only one chance to apply the Genesis multiplier, no future snapshots will occur. We're capping this at a maximum of 30 Cultists to keep it fair to the community. Exact equation pending.



**Holding Cultists:**

Whether you mint or buy a Cultist, you will receive your share as long as the cultist is in your wallet.

A % of each rebase will be distributed proportionately to holders of the Cultist NFTs. The more Cultists you hold, the higher your proportionate reward is. You will be able to buy and sell the Cultists and the reward distribution will follow. This gives the Cultist NFTs appreciative intrinsic value.



**A simple way to picture the way it works:**

Imagine taking 1% of $1,000,000 that is spread amongst 10,000 people evenly. They each would get $999 each instead of $1000. No big deal.

That leaves us with $10,000 to spread out between roughly 500 holders, as some people will hold multiple NFTs.

Each holder gets 20$ every 8 hours. 

When you take from such a large pool with many investors, and funnel it down to a small exclusive group, it goes from barely noticable to a very sizable amount.

Plus, each of those original 10,000 people have the opportunity at any time to buy a cultist and get an extra 60$, instead of losing the 1$ and getting 999$, they'd get 1059$.



**Prediction as far as the floor price of the Cultist NFTs goes, is they're going to balance out after the Genesis snapshot, then just slowly appreciate as the treasury accumulates and the project grows. As the amount staked in Sanctuary grows, so will the rebases, which means each portion paid to the holders of the NFT will also increase, increasing the value of the Cultists.**

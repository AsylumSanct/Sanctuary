# Introduction

## What is the point of Sanctuary?

[Sanctuary's](htps://www.sanctuary.fi) innovation begins with integrating the two most popular and successful aspects of the cryptocurrency industry today; Defi 2.0 Protocols and [NFTs](nfts/nftbenefits.md). Our goal is to provide everyone in the space the opportunity to increase capital through high APY [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md) options, along with [NFTs](nfts/nftbenefits.md) that not only earn holders rewards but appreciate in value over time. \
\
The end-result will be a policy-controlled, fully community governed currency system, in which the behavior of the [REAP](contracts/tokens.md) token is controlled at a high level by the DAO.&#x20;

## What is Sanctuary?

[Sanctuary](https://www.sanctuary.fi) is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the REAP token, and the [Cultist](https://www.magiceden.io/marketplace/crypto\_cultist) and [Ghost ](https://www.magiceden.io/marketplace/crypto\_cultist\_alpha\_ghosts)NFTs. Each [REAP](contracts/tokens.md) token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. USDC, mSOL) in the [Sanctuary](https://www.sanctuary.fi) treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. [Sanctuary](https://www.sanctuary.fi) also introduces [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md), as well unique rewards for holding the [NFTs](nfts/nftbenefits.md).

# Introduction

## What is the point of Sanctuary?

Sanctuary's innovation lies in the integration of the two most popular and successful aspects of the cryptocurrency industry today (Defi 2.0 Protocols and NFTs). Our goal is to provide everyone in the space the opportunity to increase capital through high APY staking and bonding options, along with NFTs that not only earn holders rewards but appreciate in value over time. \

The end-result will be a policy-controlled, fully community governed currency system, in which the behavior of the REAP token is controlled at a high level by the DAO.

## What is Sanctuary?

Sanctuary is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the REAP and SOW tokens, and the Cultist and Ghost NFTs (See the [links](broken-reference) section to view each collection on Magic Eden). Each REAP token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. USDC, mSOL) in the Sanctuary treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Sanctuary also introduces staking and bonding, as well unique rewards for holding NFTs (Cultists, Ghosts).

# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Sanctuary.** Stakers stake their REAP to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceeds gaineds via bond sales, and can vary based on the number of SOW staked in the protocol and the reward rate.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of REAP translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of REAP drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock REAP and receive an equal amount of SOW.** Your SOW balance rebases  automatically on each block (2.5 blocks per second). SOW is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you harvest (burn) SOW and receive an equal amount of REAP.**&#x20;
